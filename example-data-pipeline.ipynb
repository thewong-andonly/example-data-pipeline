      "Info:b\"Fully automated strategy. 3 EAS working simultaneously on this account. All Eas that work on this account have been tested for a period of 16 years. The idea of this signal is to work with 3 different strategies in the same account so that one compensates the other in difficult times. All orders have Stop Loss. It does not use martingale, grid or hedge. However, it is important to use an account that allows hedging, as it is possible for one strategy to be sold and another to be bought on the same asset. Target above 30% per month. If you want to follow my signal taking the same risk as me it is important to have an account with leverage 1: 500. Understand that this signal is looking for very high profits and therefore taking a greater risk. Minimum recommended capital 50 usd to follow the signal. If you want to take less risk, you can use 0.2 risk and 1: 100 leverage. Be welcome!NOTE: NOTE: The hit rate of all strategies worked on this account is quite high, however when a stop is taken we can lose up to 35% of the balance for those who assume risk equal to mine.  This will happen in a few moments.  But don't despair !!  Recovery from this loss usually occurs quickly.  We will hardly close 1 negative month!  Let's go together!\"\n",

      "Info:b\"Combination of automated trading using my own EA / Forex Robot and manual trading, minimum fund required is at least US $250 or above. The EA will open 3 trades simultaneously at 0.01 lot at low calculated risk (0.01 lot for every $100 is recommended) and the EA will closed target profit at more or less 100 points. If your fund is US $1000, the EA will open 3 positions at 0.03 lot. Lot size is automatically adjusted by EA, if the Equity decrease by $300 the lot size automatically decrease at 0.01 and if the Equity increase by $300, the EA will increase the lot size with 0.01 lot.  I execute manual cutloss only if necessary, the EA will not open Hedge or Grid position, target profit is between 10% to more than 30% a month. Average daily drawdown is between less than 1% to 12% but for worst case scenario, I'm expecting more or less 25%. By the way, based on the current performance, the EA have a more or less 90% target win rate.We focus on protecting and increasing the value of Equity / Profit and if it is necessary to cut losses for losing trades to keep the Equity / Profit in increasing the value and protect them from decreasing the value or high drawdown then we will cut the losing trades based on H4 timeframe and oversold / overbought rate and it will only need good timing.By the way, I'm trading Forex for more than 10 years now since 2009 and until now, I also created and developed my own EA that I am currently using in my trades and at the same time selling EA.\"\n",

We combine all of these inputs and add our own money management that we teach to our students.If you are looking for unrealistic number of gains this is not for you.We target to keep drawdown minimal, and we will have a hard stop if it is necessary... We saw so many systems failed here after many months of great results, the main problem being not having a hard stop... We would recommend 0.01 lot per trade for 5000 Dollars to be on the safe side... If you think that you will make so little money please just try to put your money to bank and see how much you can get from them... Also one of the thing that is missing in the market is great communication, Traders do not update investors enough sometimes do not even answer to them, we will not do that mistake'\n",

Entry points are based on will-maintained, precise calculated, and noise-free trend direction.Very Important: The minimum required deposit is 10000$ standard account or 1000$ Cent account with a minimum lot size of 0.01. This system works best with FBS Cent accounts and I am not responsible for any losses if you do not follow this recommendation. daily percentage target is 0.5 to 1% easy. 2+% in volatile days :)The targeted monthly profit/drawdown is +20%/-10%. No high leverage needed. 1:30  1:50 is more than enough.Note: The provider account has a 10K$ deposit bonus that is not considered during the risk management calculations, so the (GAIN PERCENTAGE) is less than half the real. to calculate the real gain%, multiply the total profit target by 100 then divide it by the deposit (5000$ in this account despite occasional withdrawals).'\n",

Using strict risk management guidelines, the strategy will continue trading in the initial direction until the entire trade round can close with a profit. Constantly monitored to ensure that all parameters are maintained.I use a classic (standard) account with 1:500 leverage, so please bear this in mind if you are subscribing with different leverage.

I don`t advise any client to copy with the above 100% risk and not to copy another signal jointly, as my risk management will get out of control if you choose to do so, so don't be irresponsible.The goal is to try to reach a monthly target of around 10 - 15%, but, as it is variable income, it may happen that the result is higher or lower than that.I always try to close all orders on the positive, however, it can happen closing orders on the negative, closing in basket, for example, because the security of my clients' balance is above anything, so if I have to close negative orders to make the account more secure, so I will.I operate the Majors and Minors pairs... and operate 10 exotic pairs but with low lots, consuming the same margin as normal pairs.If the Drawdown reaches the -20% floating limit, orders will no longer be opened.\"\n",

I wish us both success as we target to grow our account balance together!I have developed an effective strategy which trades 6 different currency pairs. I hope by sharing this signal that I am able to help you target grow your accounts and live a better life!Information to know:1. Monthly target is 10% growth but I will continue to trade even if I reach this target so we can maximise profits.2. Please do not close any trades manually. There will be times where our open positions are sitting in a negative position. Just remember I have my own money in here and do not want to lose it either!3. Recommended leverage is 1:5004. All positions and trading will be closed before the weekend to make sure that we don't go into the weekend with drawdown. I normally stop trading on Thursday night (AEST), so do not get worried if there are not trades happening then.\"\n",

In addition, it factors in major news and will constantly adapt risk and trade size accordingly to market conditions.  Its main parameters are designed to keep a low drawdown of 2-8% with monthly returns of 10-20%. It will only trade 6 major pairs to further spread risk between multiple pairs. Let our statistics speak for itself. Drawdown, profit factor and consistency of results monthly.This same bot manages another PAM account run by us with $1 million under management. It is consistently monitored and optimized as we have our own money at stake and much more in our other fund.We recommend a minimum of $1,000 for this system. For optimal results we recommend trading $3,000. This is due to the fact that the minimum lot size is 0.1 so drawdown will be slightly higher if you have smaller account to start with.'\n",

Manual intervention in trading is allowed to manage periods of increased volatility, for example, during election in Eurozone.Inputs are carried out by several orders (10 max) in the evening and night hours in the so-called overbought/oversold ranges.A part of orders is conducted manually to increase profits.Each order has a physical stop loss and is kept separate from others.Martingale, grid, averaging and other dangerous options for your funds are not used and will not be used.Investments in this account are recommended medium-term, from 3 months.The recommended minimum deposit is 300 USD. It is strongly recommended not to use a smaller deposit, because this can lead to the loss of all your funds.The planned average annual yield is 120%-150%.The planned drawdown on the account is 20%-25%.It is strongly recommended not to use multiplier programs to increase the volume of orders, because this can lead to a drawdown on the account much higher than expected. In the case of the use of these funds, I advise you to constantly withdraw the profit from the account.For optimal copying, I recommend using an ECN-broker with a minimum spread on the EURCHF pair (no more than 1.0 points in the Euro-American session). I have been working with the IC Markets broker for a long time providing one of the minimum spreads on the market for this currency pair.'\n",

Equity Multiplier Pro is a trading signal for people who trade professionally and are looking for a signal that is permanently and constantly focused on the positive development of equity. A signal that will accompany you conservatively and reliably in your wealth accumulation over many decades. Equity growth is the only thing that matters. We forego huge profits in a short period of time, but we also do not accept large drops in equity (equity drawdown).Recommended from account sizes of 10,000 . Small lot sizes are traded in 29 currency pairs. Up to 200 open trades at the same time for maximum diversification of risk and market phase.We focus on real equity growth and not balance growth. That is why it is not the unimportant balance drawdown benchmark that is decisive for us, but the equity drawdown benchmark. We have a profit target of 5-10% per month.From the roughly 3,500 trades per month, we make an additional 1% profit per month from rebate systems. Since signal start on 28.08.2020'\n",

      "Info:b\"Blackwave Strategy -  BasicsThe strategy is a manual grid strategy. While it has traded exotic and EM pairs profitably in the past it only trades major and minor forex pairs now to reducethe cost of SWAPS and the inherent political/geographic/economic uncertainty around many exotic/EM pairs.  When markets are overbought or close to overbought trades are openedcounter-trend. When profit targets are hit trades are closed. If the market continues to move against the initial position then a second trade is opened based on candlestickprice action and how the market is trading/pending news etc.  Up to 12 positions maybe opened.When markets are oversold or close to oversold trades are opened counter-trend. When profit targets are hit trades are closed. If the market continues to move against theinitial position then a second trade is opened based on candlestick price action and how the market is trading/pending news etc.  Up to 12 positions may be opened.Risk control is achieved through position sizing. Position sizing MUST be the most important feature of the strategy because there is no hard stop loss and no hedging. People will often happily accept extraordinary profits and only query the strategy when they experience a stressful drawdown in their own account even while the master account remains quite safe. This is because they have failed to understand how crucial position sizing is for the strategy.While there is no hard stop loss there is a soft one which is market dependent and as follows;Blackwave California - Target 15% Blackwave Pacific    - Target 35%   Blackwave Alpine     - Target 50% Blackwave California $3000 = 0.01 lotsBlackwave Pacific $1700    = 0.01 lotsBlackwave Alpine $1000     = 0.01 lots   now is one of the oldest strategies on most copy trading platforms. It is the inspiration for three MAM accounts managing $3m of other peoples money. I never place trades in client accounts that I do not wish to place in my own accounts too and as at June 2019 my own commitment to this strategy across all three risk levels is $190k. These are the basics. To give any more information would be to reduce my flexibility and take away the major advantage of a manual strategy and make it effectively automated. As a former stockbroker I like to watch all markets at once and get a sense of what's going on rather than put blind faith in back-testing which in the end only tests the past.\"\n",

Better than the bank right?You may see that my rates of gains are decreasing and start wondering.  This is due to risk mitigation through Covid and highly non-standard U.S. Elections.

And a minimum leverage of 1:200.My aim is to provide safe, secure and consistent returns which would (a) definitely beat what the bank would give you; (b) seek to well beat what the best hedge funds would be able to achieve over the course of a year; (c) are currency pair diversified; and (d) with low draw-down.My published signals will always be from Live, Real Personal Money accounts, and wherever such features are offered,they will always be validated through Live Track Record and Live Trading Privileges verification.

FOKEY POINTS - Safe martingale mode:\\tThis signal uses a safe martingale approach and has a maximum of three positions open;\\tEach trade is protected by a stop-loss;\\tMax target expected drawdown is less than 15%;\\tMonthly target expected gains is between 50% to 100%;\\tThis signal trades GBPAUD only;\\tUSE an ECN account for best results;\\tMinimum leverage 1:20  ESMA friendly;\\tProp Trader friendly;\\tThis version is not FIFO compliant.Many traders consider averaging and Martingale signals to be dangerous and toxic. We agree that such strategies without good risk management are dangerous. However, with conventional risk management tools such as a stop-loss and trailing stop, many benefits can accrue to the trader. So let us take it from the top as though the reader is new to trading.In forex trading, the Martingale strategy calls for traders to keep increasing their position size until they make a winning trade. A pure Martingale strategy calls for a trader to double their trade after each loss to recover losses. However, the trader can also make gradual increasing to their original position until they recoup their losses. The Martingale approach has been criticized by many commenters who have been unable to tame or control this type of strategy. However, Freedom Reparations has most certainly tamed and controlled the Martingale approach and the real time signal performance suggests that if done correctly with the correct money management strategy and fixed stop loss, there are numerous benefits to be had.Averaging Down with the Martingale StrategyWhen a position begins falling, a trade can sell and take the loss, hold and hope, or average down. Averaging down in forex simply means throwing more money after the loss with the hope that it will eventually perform well.Averaging is used to avoid losses instead of seeking profits. The Martingale strategy may be implemented via a number of closed positions that have gone against you or averaging an open position. In the first instance, there is loss and in the next position, the volume is doubled. In the second instance, there is unrealized loss with the volume being added to an open position. Doubling down is at the heart of the Martingale strategy.Averaging entails buying more of a position of something that you have invested as price drops. It lowers the average price, which makes it easier to break even or make a profit. It is worth noting that it makes it easier to lose more as you have more invested in the position.It is dangerous when the position has shown weakness instead of strength. Some feel that sending more money after a loss is compounding the problem. However, it is a great option when combined with fixed stop loss.This signal operates smoothly and is protected by a stop-loss and a trailing stop-loss.Optimization has been conducted using cross-validation to avoid over-optimization and destructive curve fitting.The strategy can be tick by tick adaptable if needed.'\n",

      "Info:b\"- STRATEGY. Multicurrency short-term trade during asian session based on indicator analysis + integrated additional filters. Average holding time up to several hours, seldom trades may keep running for a few days. Quantity of pairs varies (from 5 to 15) subject to market condition changes and regular optimisation process. - SAFETY. Never use: grid techniques, martingale. All orders always have fixed Stop Loss levels.- (!) TARGET PROFIT (!). Please always keep in mind that this strategy is focused on safety, thus there is no straightforward upwards profitability line. A lot of minor lossy trades will occur, because this system tries to avoid keeping orders for days and catching big losses. Therefore target monthly result can not be predicted, but you could use historical data to have overall understanding. It is important to keep in mind that lossy trades and even lossy months will occur - this is part of strategy! Patience is the key.- BROKER. Choose reliable broker with true ECN order execution. Incorrectly chosen broker will lead to losses due to huge slippage and high spread.- RISK MANAGEMENT. Recommended minimum deposit 500 USD. Risk level is 10% per one trade, several orders might be open during one asian session.- RESPONSIBILITY. You and only you are responsible for trading result, risk factor and possible losses. Even when you copy a signal! This is a very important idea if you wish to be a profitable FOREX trader on long-term. Yes I understand that it is so easy to blame bad broker, lossy signal manager or bad luck in a loss occurred. But only once you accept 100% responsibility on your shoulders you open your mind to opportunities on improving financial result - changing a broker, becoming more careful & smart, change the way to choose MQL5 signal etc. Otherwise FOREX is just a casino for you. - DIVERSIFICATION. All FOREX media sources write about it, yet I will also mention this topic because it is crucial. Forex investments should be diversified in such a way, that profits gained are valuable enough, yet a possible loss won't stun you with panic. Based on this principle, bigger investments should be dedicated to safe and stable signals, while smaller funds should be dedicated to aggressive signals.- PROFIT WITHDRAWALS. Yes, this is a must-have if you want to be profitable on FOREX. Only you decide how often and how much % profit should be withdrawn from each account. But you have to do it if you want to avoid big losses on unexpected force-majeure situation. By the way, such procedure also increases your mood and excitement, because it is so nice to withdraw profits, isn't it? :-)\"\n",

I have trading experience in large brokerage companies such as SaxoBank, Alpari, FXPro. I have decided to share my trading experience with you by providing my signals in SignalStart.Trade is conducted by me in the manual mode, for the opening of positions using a special advisor/assistant (automatically calculates the trading lot). I rely only on my analytics and trade in technical analysis, also not forgetting about important fundamental data. There is a short and medium-term trade, based on psychological levels of support and resistance. The number of open transactions per month depends only on the market situation and on how I see the market. Trading is carried out on major currency pairs. Most often, trades are conducted in the European session, sometimes in the American. Orders are often closed within a few hours, but sometimes open positions can be opened for several days.Not used martingale or grid. Each open position is PROTECTED by Stop Loss.Respectfully, LoginPeace'\n",

      "Info:b\"Update: FXCM are moving the regulator from London to Cyprus due to BREXIT and moving these funds to a new account number. This is a huge shame as I will lose five years worth of data, but due to subscribers requests I will create a new Blackwave Australia when FXCMs process is completed. It is all due to happen in February 2021. Sorry for inconvenience.Manual Grid System created in 2015 with about $600 making it one of the oldest signals on this website. I honed my grid skills with this account. In my view it's high risk but looking around signalstart apparently it's not :-).These days I manage over two million dollars across various managed accounts at IC Markets but this tough old account at FXCM is close to my heart. I don't foresee making a withdrawal and actually I am happy to ride this for another ten fold increase if the markets and my skills permit.Blackwave Strategy -  BasicsThe strategy is a manual grid strategy. While it has traded exotic and EM pairs profitably in the past it only trades major and minor forex pairs now to reducethe cost of SWAPS and the inherent political/geographic/economic uncertainty around many exotic/EM pairs.  When markets are overbought or close to overbought trades are openedcounter-trend. When profit targets are hit trades are closed. If the market continues to move against the initial position then a second trade is opened based on candlestickprice action and how the market is trading/pending news etc.  Up to 12 positions maybe opened.When markets are oversold or close to oversold trades are opened counter-trend. When profit targets are hit trades are closed. If the market continues to move against theinitial position then a second trade is opened based on candlestick price action and how the market is trading/pending news etc.  Up to 12 positions may be opened.Risk control is achieved through position sizing. Position sizing MUST be the most important feature of the strategy because there is no hard stop loss and no hedging. People will often happily accept extraordinary profits and only query the strategy when they experience a stressful drawdown in their own account even while the master account remains quite safe. This is because they have failed to understand how crucial position sizing is for the strategy.While there is no hard stop loss there is a soft one which is market dependent and as follows;Blackwave California - Target 15% Blackwave Pacific    - Target 35%   Blackwave Alpine     - Target 50% Blackwave California $3000 = 0.01 lotsBlackwave Pacific $1700    = 0.01 lotsBlackwave Alpine $1000     = 0.01 lots   now is one of the oldest strategies on most copy trading platforms. It is the inspiration for three MAM accounts managing $3m of other peoples money. I never place trades in client accounts that I do not wish to place in my own accounts too and as at June 2019 my own commitment to this strategy across all three risk levels is $190k. These are the basics. To give any more information would be to reduce my flexibility and take away the major advantage of a manual strategy and make it effectively automated. As a former stockbroker I like to watch all markets at once and get a sense of what's going on rather than put blind faith in back-testing which in the end only tests the past.\"\n",

      "Info:b'Fully automated trading with Momentum Capture EA. No martingale or averaging used. Every position has a clearly defined stop loss, usually between 20-100 pips. The EA trades during the hours after speeches from central bankers or other central bank events. It does not trade very often, but historically it has been good in catching the momentum afterwards without too much risk in periods of low volatility. Therefore, the EA can be seen as a \"long-term volatility bet\". After detecting strong price action and momentum, it will open positions in trend direction as well as pending orders for a possible reversal.The Following symbols will be traded: EURUSD,EURJPY,EURAUD,EURCAD,GBPUSD,USDCAD,USDCHF,GBPJPY,AUDJPY,USDJPY,AUDUSD,EURGBP,EURCHF and CADJPYRisk Management: The maximum number of market orders as well as pending orders is 32. So 64 orders in total, but there should not be more than 32 open because market orders will probably hit SL before pending orders get executed. On $5000 the master account will use a maximum of 16 orders with 0.02 lots as well as 16 orders with alternative settings and 0.01 lots. Therefore, the total lotsize of open orders for $5000 would be 0.48, so basically a maximum leverage of 10 (but at least 20 is needed because of pending orders). If you prefer less use of leverage, please adjust the risk multiplier accordingly! The historical maximum drawdown in an 8-year portfolio backtest starting 2010 was about $317 per 0.01 lots and 16 max orders, so $950 (or 19%) for the current settings on a $5000 balance. The maximum stagnation period was 105 days in the portfolio backtest. In backtests the current settings would have made about $2500 in a year on a $5000 account, so 50%, but considering optimization bias 20-40% is probably more realistic. Of course, none can predict the future. We can only judge from historic tests and live trades.'\n",

      "Info:b\"READY FOR 2021! A tough 2020 for me but always pushing forward. Let's Get that money!  Hello and welcome to my Signals Service. Just so you know, I only trade ONE CURRENCY PAIR AT A TIME! I have seen so many traders in tons of positions. Its impossible to predict many currency pair movements at once.  It's best to stay focused on ONE CURRENCY PAIR.  Also like to mention that I only use 1 to 50 leverage ONLY!!!! I don't believe in over leveraging your trades. Recommended minimum deposit $1,500 to $2,000. Also like to mention trades may not go through if balance is below $1,000. Can set multiplier to 1 which mirrors the same exact risk as me, but if want to lower to reduce risk that's ok.  *I recommend to pause the system as well if you are withdrawing profits! Once the funds go out of your broker than you can resume the system.Just to let my subscribers or future subscribers know I usually trade from Sunday to Wednesday, especially if by Wednesday I am up for the week.\"\n",

When the trend changes as identified by the indicators, so do the open trades. The trades slowly build waiting for the outbreak. The drops were due to me panicking and closing out some trades only to later find that the EA would have actually done what it was designed to do. I have worked on changing the settings in order to bring much less risk to the table on each and every trade and have been running those settings since October 5th as you can see. Now that the settings are set, I will slowly be increasing trade sizes.Enjoy!P.S. Scalping in the trend to come later...'\n",

(To avoid loss due to large short sale)There are other exit methods using time and technical indicators.KonokaSystem is not aimed at increasing the winning rate.Back test (BT) is verified in 20 years.We did not use \"Every Tick\" for this verification.BT \"Every Tick\" has a margin of price error.Since KonokaSystem is a closing price-based logic, we verify BT with \"Open price only\".Closing price based verification is the best way to make BT and forward testing (FT) similar.Like \"TradeStation\" and \"MultiCharts\", it can be verified quickly even for a long period.Also, GMT offset time is not needed to make FT and BT verification similar. (Verified)MT4 server time (00:00) is the end of NY market (17:00'\n",

      "Info:b\"AUTOMATIC REAL PIPS is a 100% automated single currency trend following system, trading on the H1 timeframe. It opens positions in EURUSD around the clock when key levels in the market are breached, diversifying account's exposure in small positions of 2% risk each. It has a special customized martingale and trailing profit functionality for all open positions combined if so desired. It does not open opposite positions, so an account with hedging capability is not needed.Maximum drawdown target during live testing has been around 20-30%, but very rarely a larger drawdown is possible. Therefore I strongly advise to use only half of your available capital in this signal, keeping the other half out on a different account as back up funds. If the balance ever gets low on the account then you can transfer the funds from your backup to accommodate the following trade.Target profit 5-15% a month.Suggested set up: Any Forex Broker 1:500 leverage (minimum) ECN account and MQL5 New York Based VPS, with a ping lower than 5ms.Minimum deposit: $250\"\n",

      "Info:b'Hi there, I am trading 22 Pairs, all trades are executed by an algorithm, I do not manually change trades. Entry and exit points are determined by HiLo and Trend patterns. A strict money management function is designed to keep risk at low levels without cutting profits. This is done by controlling positions permanently without the use of T/P or S/L levels. The algorithm only enters the market if many parameters are in line with the strategy, this means it can go without a single trade for days but when the market situation changes, trade several times per day. The average holding time is about 30 days - so medium term. I recommend to invest 5000 USD to keep risks low, less investment will result in a higher % performance but larger risks.'\n",

      "Info:b\"After 7 years of experience in forex, after the creation of two indicators and a robot expert advisor, I am happy to present you my first trading signal.This is a semi-automatic signal that is generated by an indicator based on moving averages, volumes and price fluctuation.Orders can be opened and closed either automatically or manually as they are convinced that a fully automatic system is not capable of generating long-term profits.The manual operations allow to filter the signals and to allow the opening of the operations when the signal is stronger and truly reflects the strategy used.Currency, cryptocurrency and index transactions are opened.The account used was opened on IG Market in 2018 to be able to perform various tests on indicators and robots but the strategy I propose in the signal was activated in this real account only in July 2019 after several months of testing.Use an account with at least 350 euros of funds (preferably 500 euros).DISCLAIMEROnline trading of financial instruments and / or cryptocurrency is one of the most stimulating activities to perform online.Trading online implies an investment of money and as the ancient Roman deity of Giano Bifronte has two sides of the same coin: the investment can be profitable or the one invested can be lost in whole or in part.For this reason, anyone who wants to venture into this field and sector must:- Be well informed about the risks and costs associated with trading on financial markets;- Carefully evaluate your investment objectives;- Calibrate the amounts to invest based on the capacity to absorb possible losses;- Be aware of your own levels of experience and risk appetite;- Take full responsibility for economic risksThe owner of this signal assumes no responsibility for the use of the data and prices provided, for the use of the indicators, price signals, robots, Expert Advisors: the user or user is the only one responsible for the results of its decisions.The speculative activity in the forex involves economic risks therefore whoever does it does it under his own and exclusive responsibility.------ Italiano -------Dopo 7 anni di esperienza nel forex, dopo la creazione di due indicatori e un robot expert advisor sono contento di presentarvi il mio primo segnale trading.Questo  un segnale semi automatico che viene generato da un indicatore basato su medie mobili, volumi e oscillazione dei prezzi.L'apertura e la chiusura degli ordini pu avvenire sia automaticamente sia manualmente in quanto sono convinto che un sistema completamente automatico non sia in grado di generare profitti a lungo termine.Le operazioni manuali permetto di filtrare i segnali e di consentire l'apertura delle operazioni quando il segnale  pi forte e rispecchia veramente la strategia utilizzata.Vengono aperte operazioni su valute, criptovalute e indici.Il conto utilizzato  stato aperto su IG Market nel 2018 per poter eseguire diversi test su indicatori e robot ma la strategia che propongo nel segnale  stata attivata in questo conto reale solamente a Luglio 2019 dopo diversi mesi di test.Utilizzare un conto con almeno 350 euro di fondi (meglio se 500 Euro).DISCLAIMERIl trading on line degli strumenti finanziari e/o di criptovalute  una della attivit pi stimolanti da svolgere in rete.Fare trading on line implica un investimento di denaro e come lantica divinit romana di Giano Bifronte ha due facce della stessa medaglia: linvestimento pu essere remunerativo oppure quello che si  investito pu perdersi in tutto od in parte.Per questo motivo chiunque voglia avventurarsi in questo campo e settore deve: Essere bene informato sui rischi ed i costi associati al trading sui mercati finanziari; Valutare attentamente i propri obiettivi di investimento; Calibrare gli importi da investire in ragione della capacit di assorbimento di possibili perdite; Essere consapevole dei propri livelli di esperienza e di propensione al rischio; Assumersi la piena responsabilit dei rischi economiciIl titolare di questo segnale non si assume alcuna responsabilit per lutilizzo dei dati e prezzi forniti, per lutilizzo degli indicatori, dei segnali di prezzo, dei Robot, degli Expert Advisor: lutente o lutilizzatore  lunico responsabile per i risultati delle proprie decisioni.Lattivit speculativa nel forex comporta rischi economici quindi chiunque la svolga lo fa sotto la propria ed esclusiva responsabilit.\"\n",

      "Info:b'I want to bring to your attention my signal IrrefutableMy latest Expert Advisor, which we developed with the team for 4 months, is trading on the account. Eight currency pairs are involved in trading, testing was carried out in the TDS2 program with a floating spread and imitation of slippage.The EA trades around the clock. The filter uses the maximum number of currency pairs in the market, as well as the filter of the maximum drawdown, above which new orders for other currencies will not be opened. Take profit is floating and depends on three exit filters.To hedge against unprofitable entries, the averaging method is used - opening a grid of orders when the price moves against the direction of the position.A distinctive feature of the advisor is the floating Stop Loss, which can vary from 1 to 30% of the deposit balance. 4 different filters are responsible for its size: the first filter is to move the position to breakeven, the second and third catch price rollbacks by the required percentage of the balance. If these three filters did not cope with the task, then all orders are closed when a drawdown is reached, calculated as $ 500-700 per 0.01 trading lot (a different value for each pair). Those. The risk per group of orders cannot exceed more than 1/3 of the account deposit.At the moment, the EA has been tested on a real account for 3 months and has shown itself perfectly in market conditions.The account is aggressive, unlike my other systems, and is set up for accelerated profit making, therefore the risks are appropriate. Please consider these when investing.Recommended broker: Alpari, Roboforex and others with ECN account typeMinimum balance: $ 1500 per 0.01 trading lot'\n",

      "Info:b\"Update Dec 2020 : 15% overall profit for the year has been reached. As the DD is now over 20% I'll aim for using all the profit made in Dec to close some loosers. EURCAD will go down quckly in Q1 2021, USDCHF Will go up, so I'm not worry. Might start closing some EURUSD firstTrader since many years my minimal target is 2% per month, which makes an annual return target of 27% with compounded interests. As you can see, Most of the time I overachieve this performance though. Most of my trades got a positive swap exchange overnight which helps keeping position a long time if needed. I try to target to keep my free margin at 600% minimum (1:30 leverage / European standard) to prevent any big drawdown and cover the account in case of a flash crash.\"\n",

No dangerous strategies such as martingale, grid or dollar cost averaging are used. All strategies traded are pure price action based, with a fixed stop-loss and profit-target when a trade is triggered. Once it moves in our favor, the risk is reduced as soon a possible, enabling a very small drawdown to the account.The portfolio is comprised out of 5 in house developed automated trading systems (algorithms), as well as 4 manually traded strategies which are all feeding the master portfolio. This master portfolio is relatively new but the underlaying strategies have traded with double/triple digit returns for years. The portfolio is aimed at diversifying risk as much as possible in terms of assets that are traded, time and market cycles. All 28 major and minor forex pairs, CFDs, as well as metals and indices are traded.Trades are taken from the 15 minute, up to the weekly and monthly time frames, where some systems are built to perform well in consolidating or ranging markets, while others shine during trending conditions. All of this to make sure no strategies overlap and we double down on risk, which is capped target at max 1% of the account balance per single trade. ** USE IC MARKETS RAW-SPREAD 1:500 TRADING ACCOUNT FOR IDENTICAL RESULTS **'\n",

      "Info:b'Key Features:1. Strategy: For 3 years, the strategy was mainly CARRY trading. Given that the coronavirus of 2020 has completely altered the intrest rate outlook for a long period to come, the carry play will not work and we will temporarily employ other medium to long term strategies.2. Leverage: low leverage (exposure on average between 3-4X balance size). On exceptional occasions, exposure can be 20-30x balance size, this happens very rarely. 3. Trade duration: between several days and weeks.4. Drawdown: currently historic drawdown of 32% (coronavirus crisis 2020). We would leave room for a DD of up to 50 if warranted by the situation. On average, the target drawdown will be kept at 20%.5. Trading frequency: low. This is NOT a scalping or day-trading strategy and it avoids over-trading and over-leveraging. Only 5-10 trading tickets per week (or a multiple of de-leveraged tickets to scale into a position ). It is possible no trading takes place for several days, until an ideal situation/opportunity presents itself.   6. Professionalism: This is a conservative strategy traded and managed manually by a accomplished market veteran. Only emergency protective stops far away of current market to avoid broker stop runs.7. Minimum account size:  USD 1,000, but then risk is 4X the risk of the master account.Last but not least:1. the usual DISCLAIMERS apply.  Leveraged FX trading is very risky. Only trade with money that you can afford to lose. Past performance is no guarantee for future results. In FX, anything can happen and you should bear this in mind at all times. 2. For large accounts > 100,000, please contact us.'\n",

      "Info:b\"This is a portfolio of 22 strategies including mainly breakout strategies, which is the source of profit, and mean reversion ones, which act as equity curve smoother.  Each strategy has undergone rigorous backtest using more than 10 years of history data. Robustness of strategy is assured by monte carlo testing that simulate numerous scenarios that could possibly happen in the market.We applied very strict risk control policies requiring each strategy to have stop loss levels. Each strategy contributes less than 5% of the total risk and is diversified by trading style and instruments. Although the drawdown is a bit of large in this live account, you may adjust your leverage to lower the risk. On average you can expect at least a 1:1 ratio of annual return to max drawdown.Don't expect the equity curve to be as smooth as a straight line. This is NOT our target and it is too dangerous for us to pursue. We believe that long term success could only be achieved by a reasonably choppy equity curve.\"\n",

      "Info:b\"Welcome Traders,I have been trading for over 10 years with very good success and I'm sharing my techniques thru copy trading.I know it can be daunting trusting someone else with your hard earned money, but unlike other signals on here I have a proven track record and have maneuvered even the hardest markets during the COVID19 pandemic.Trades are in and out the same day, unlike other signals and algo signals. It involves S&R trading, it is very profitable and is completely manual.Trades will be executed with no Stop Loss and will not remain open for more than 2-3 hours. Please do not invest money you are not prepared to lose as trading forex is a very risky. If you follow my account you will see the returns but also see how fast your account grows using this strategy. Trades will be limited in the European and US session.I am a real trader based in the UK, using my own real money on a live account. I wish you all the best in your future investments and hopefully see you on my copying service.Minimum requirements will be : 1.)   Low Spread Broker is a must! (I use ICMarkets)2.)   Good Leverage  (I use 1:500)3.)   A minimum account balance of 500 (this will provide more than enough income to be able to pay for the subscription\"\n",

Sometimes it is called the pattern of the \"numbers of life\".This pattern in reflected in multiple Fibonacci indicators, which we use to find great trading opportunities. Market is like a living creature and numbers of life can and should be applied to it.We use Fibonacci retracement levels to understand the direction of the market, find entry and exit price. At the same time, we use Fibonacci cycles for entry and exit time. Also, our approach involves analysis of multiple currency pairs simultaneously in order to understand dominating currency within a pair and its direction.Such approach provides a volumetric vision on the entire market, enabling us to get the highest probability trade with the lowest risk possible. We know exactly when to enter and exit the market. There is zero guesswork in all our trading activities'\n",

      "Info:b'On 1. of August 2019, I started the live trading Ultima EA. Until end of the year, I was at 111%. At the begining, there were still bugs to be fixed, but once that was completed, by the end of the year, profit just rocketed! At one point I was even at 1114%. Last couple of months there is again stagnation due choppy market movement, but system managed to preserve the capital anyway, so Im more than happy. Currently, my profit is around 1000%. I target by the end of this year to be at 2000%.System basicly waits for a trend, then retracement and continuation. During range, only sole task of it is to preseve capital as much as possible. So if we have range that lasts for several months, dont expect any profits, but when we do have one, it can double your account in a week time. So its a long term system , but defenetly pays off.'\n",

I trade with IC Markets (Australia). My goal is slowly but surely to build up a fortune. Of course there will be losses from time to time, but over a longer period of time the goal is to make a lot of money. Please deposit at least 500 USD on the account and choose a small lot size. I lost much money since I traded signals from others but I quit that now on November 27th 2020 and traded also on my own during the last weeks while I still got signals from others. I could have opened another account but I will show to you and be honest to you. I will trade almost all trades with stop loss. We will have around 200 trading days a year and will trade mostly US30, USTECH and Gold but also some currency pairs. Aim is 1% growth per day. Good luck to us all'\n",

      "Info:b\"Low drawdown combined with multiple take profit targets for each trade.Intra day and positional/swing trades both will be done. At all times stop losses would be defined to maintain the best risk to reward ratio.The worst strategy is to carry losses and the best start is to define losses. We won't let you down as account preservation is our primary goal. Signal providers often open multiple accounts with a 100-200 $ account balance to attract new clients and open multiple signals simultaneously. Even if the account blows up they don't care so they go full risk on, mostly without stop losses.But if you live to see another day (if your account stays good for more trades) only then you can grow your account. To Win the current position, if one carries the loss into a no return territory, it is the silliest thing to do.We never:---Fight the trend, instead, we try to gain from it.--Give into emotions--Add to losing trades.We always :Stick strictly to the plan.Use less than 20% of funds (balance) for open positions. Use stop losses in most places, else a hard stop always in place.THE REAL WEALTH IS ONLY CREATED BY COMPOUNDING THROUGH CONSISTENCY.\"\n",

      "Info:b'More than 12 years of trading experienceThe strategy is based on fundamental analysis, sometimes individual elements of graphical analysis are used. Particular attention is paid to support and resistance levels.Only manual trading.Compliance with money management (limiting risks)Metals, oil and cryptocurrencies are not traded.Average monthly target profitability - 30%Recommended parameters when copying a signal:- deposit - $ 1,000;- leverage 1 to 100 is possible and more (but not less than 1 to 100);Your account can be opened with any broker except Instaforex. If your account is opened with Instaforex your profit will be 10 times less than that of other subscribers.Additional information:The signal account is opened with the Instaforex broker, which uses a non-standard lot equal to 10,000 (a regular lot is equal to 100,000). Therefore, for correct copying on the signal, the total volume of simultaneously open orders has been reduced and subscribers only need to adhere to the recommended parameters for copying.Use for copying accounts opened with any broker, except Instaforex.'\n",

      "Info:b'Hello and welcome to Safeguard Profits. This pure FX majors strategy rolls on a REAL 1:500 632.36 (initial equity) account. Lot sizes are automatically calculated for a 0.3 % risk on each trade. This is a FIFO compliant strategy and therefore no martingale, no grid take part: no more than one position will be opened because risk management is the priority. Strategy exploits always the same key pattern and therefore the risk reward ratio (RRR) is always intended to be around 2. Even though some winning trades can be prematurely closed by the trailing profit procedure at lower levels of effective RRR. Low spread is key to optimally extract the maximum profits from this system. Trades are short term: common trade time is 20 minutes. Thanks and good luck.'\n",

We have been in the trading industry for over 20 years and have never found an expert EA that always outperforms. Starting balance should be at least 300.Notes:1) The trading account has to be a real RAW/ECN account with your broker.2) Never withdraw funds or add funds while positions are open, this will close out open positions. Wait till positions are closed and withdraw to a secondary account and then withdraw that profit from that secondary account as not to interfere with the trading account.3) Enjoy!'\n",

      "Info:b\"*TRADING IS CURRENTLY STOPPED, IT WILL RESUME ON 4TH JANUARY 2021 AS THE MARKET IS TOO VOLATILE*-I am using self made Trading Robot that has been tested for 2 years and trying to help other make money together with me in my 1 Million Pounds Journey.I am using the Robot currently with an account balance 1000 and it is martingale strategy based robot but it will place the TP & SL in each trades and it will change as more trades opens. The robot is totally different then any other out there, very low risk compared to any other martingale robot.I would say that to begin start of with X1 Multiplier, I advise do not use fixed lot as risk factor as its martingale strategy robot.This copy trading will be based on 1k account risk, I will be opening larger account and connecting to the bot as we grow which then you can do the same but currently start of with 1k and use x1 multiplier thats my advice, I guess you could do high multiplier as well but I don't know if it works out well. Enjoy the profits.\"\n",

      "Info:b\"Thank you for checking our signal. We mostly trade majors with accent on EURUSD for now. Although we trade during all major sessions (Asian, European and US), we don't take trades that we do not consider solid and we avoid trading during high-impact news events. - all trades have stop loss (SL)- no martingale, grid or any other risky strategies- low minimum required balance (you can start with as low as $100)During weekends we analyze the previous week's performance together with the next week fx calendar and adjust our strategies accordingly. We run several real and demo accounts in parallel and check new pairs all the time. For us to introduce a new pair into our trading signal means to pass 3 - 6 months worth of tests on real accounts, with above the average results. For best performance we recommend a broker with tight spreads. May the markets be with you!\"\n",

      "Info:b'This system is based on a technical analysis of the market for five major currencies, which occupies a dominant position in terms of volume. At certain weights, changes in oil and gold prices are taken into account. Trading is carried out on the main and derivative assets, the most volatile at significant intervals. The intraday mechanical trading system (EA) operates at time intervals M15, H1, D1. Positions are held from several hours to several days depending on the intensity of price movement. Some transactions are closed within an hour. Fundamental movements are followed by weeks. During a quick change in the price of an asset, positions are protected by hidden stop orders. In trading, a fixed percentage of the deposit is used to reduce risks and preserve the trading history of maximum duration, so that investors can independently determine, based on evidence, the advantages and disadvantages of the experts used in this account. The system uses the maximum available amount of assets to diversify risks.'\n",

      "Info:b'Welcome to the Good News! We trade in unique trading series, entering reasonably sized Buys and/or Sells until the desired profit target is eventually hit.  That may be the first trade, or the 5th trade, or whatever it takes until the profit is made.  No special accounts, requirements or minimum balances necessary.  So do not panic if some trades are missed in a row.  That is what happened the last few days of June when the account started trading, until that trade series was finished in July.  You will see this pattern in the trading history of the Signal.  Of course there are no guarantees, but thats the system.Its extremely unlikely that Your account will be in jeopardy, and it wont be subject to those huge drawdowns, because every trade is stopped out or hits the profit target, with a reasonable loss or gain, until the overall trade series ends with a profit, whether that happens in a few hours or a few weeks, or whatever time is necessary, depending on market conditions.So sit back and enjoy the ride.  We are looking forward to a long and mutually beneficial trading relationship with you.   Now thats Good News.'\n",

    "* So, dynamic pages are a real pain.  As I mentioned before, there's no way of selecting number of records through Selenium, so instead of cycling through 8 pages of 100, I cycled through 20 pages of 39.  The approach was to have the script look for the elements in the same window and once the next page button was clicked, repeat the script.  This worked well, if a little slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clicking the next button requires an explicit wait.  I couldn't get an implicit/explicit wait to work, so I used `time.sleep()` instead aka cheating.\n",
